# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Description

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is curious about cryptocurrencies and how they could be implemented into an investment portfolio for their clients. Weâ€™ve been tasked with creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and if they could be grouped into a classification system for further analysis. For this project we did the following

* Preprocessed the data for PCA
* Reduced data dimensions using PCA
* Clustered cryptocurrencies using K-means
* Visualized our results

## Results

As we can see from our images there is a concentrated grouping between class 3 and class 0 that indicates the bulk of tradeable coins lives within these parameters. Class 2 is an outlier and class 1 represents a slightly larger outlier than class 2. Further studies would be needed to derive more results.
